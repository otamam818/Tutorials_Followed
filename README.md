# Tutorials_Followed

A repo where I showcase the tutorials I followed, and possibly changed up


__Note__: This does _not_ showcase __everything__ that I have been practicing over any set period of time. Its intention is to make clear what I have started and when I have started it.

I intend to showcase my final proficiency in any technology through other individual repos.
